	Abstract = {Many approaches to measure the similarity between concepts that exist in two different ontologies are used in the matchers of ontology alignment systems. These matchers belong to various categories depending on the context of the similarity measurement, such as lexical, structural, or extensional matchers. Although OA systems have used various forms of similarity measures along with some background knowledge sources, not many have incorporated the use of semantic similarity measures. This paper first reviews the use of semantic similarity in current OA systems, presents a unique application of such measures to assess the semantic alignment quality (SAQ) of OA systems and reports on the results of a study done using SAQ measures on the OAEI 2010 results from the anatomy track},

	Abstract = {Current retrieval and recommendation approaches rely on hard-wired data models. This hinders personalized customizations to meet information needs of users in a more flexible manner. Therefore, the paper investigates how similarity-based retrieval strategies can be combined with graph queries to enable users or system providers to explore repositories in the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud more thoroughly. For this purpose, we developed novel content-based recommendation approaches. They rely on concept annotations of Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) vocabularies and a SPARQL-based query language that facilitates advanced and personalized requests for openly available knowledge graphs. We have comprehensively evaluated the novel search strategies in several test cases and example application domains (i.e., travel search and multimedia retrieval). The results of the web-based online experiments showed that our approaches increase the recall and diversity of recommendations or at least provide a competitive alternative strategy of resource access when conventional methods do not provide helpful suggestions. The findings may be of use for Linked Data-enabled recommender systems (LDRS) as well as for semantic search engines that can consume LOD resources.},

@article{Wang2016,
	Abstract = {A recommender system helps individual users find the preferred items rapidly and has attracted extensive attention in recent years. Many successful recommendation algorithms are designed on bipartite networks, such as network-based inference or heat conduction. However, most of these algorithms define the resource-allocation methods for an average allocation. That is not reasonable because average allocation cannot indicate the user choice preference and the influence between users which leads to a series of non-personalized recommendation results. We propose a personalized recommendation approach that combines the similarity function and bipartite network to generate a similarity network that improves the resource-allocation process. Our model introduces user influence into the recommender system and states that the user influence can make the resource-allocation process more reasonable. We use four different metrics to evaluate our algorithms for three benchmark data sets. Experimental results show that the improved recommendation on a similarity network can obtain better accuracy and diversity than some competing approaches.},

@article{Qian2016,
	Abstract = {Recommendation is an important and also challenging problem in online social networks. It needs to consider not only users' personalized interests, but also social relations between users. Indeed, in practice, users are often inclined to accept recommendations from friends or opinion leaders (users with high reputations). In this paper, we present a novel recommendation framework, social recommendation using global rating reputation and local rating similarity, which combine user reputation and social similarity based on ratings. User reputation can be obtained by iteratively calculating the correlation of historical ratings of user and intrinsic qualities of items. We view the user reputation as the user's global influence and the similarity based on rating of social relation as the user's local influence, introduce it in the basic social recommender model. Thus users with high reputation have a strong influence on the others, and on the other hand, the effect of a user with low reputation has been weakened. The recommendation accuracy of proposed framework can be improved by effectively removing nature noise because of less rigorous user ratings and strengthening the effect of user influence with high reputation. We also improve the similarity based on ratings by avoiding the high similarity with the less common ratings between friends. We evaluate our approach on three datasets including Movielens, Epinions and Douban. Empirical results demonstrate that proposed framework achieves significant improvements on recommendation accuracy. User reputation and local similarity which are both based on ratings have a lot of helpful in improvement of prediction accuracy. The reputation also can help to improve the recommendation precision with the small training sets.},

	Abstract = {We propose a recommendation method that considers the user's individual preference and influence from other users in social media. This method predicts the user's individual preference and influence from other users by applying the probability of divergence from random-selection based on a statistical hypothesis test as a form of modified content-based filtering. We evaluated the proposed method by focusing on the rate at which items that have recommended tags are contained among all items. The proposed method is shown to have higher accuracy than traditional content-based filtering. It is especially effective when some percentage of the items have recommendation tags.},

It is shown to outperform all other known community detection methods in terms of computation time. Moreover, the quality of the communities detected is very good, as measured by the so-called modularity. This is shown first by identifying language communities in a Belgian mobile phone network of 2 million customers and by analysing a web graph of 118 million nodes and more than one billion links. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified on ad hoc modular networks.},

This article presents a semantic model, non probabilistic and predictive, for the decisional analysis of professional and institutional social networks. The presented multidisciplinary model, in parallel to Galam sociophysics, integrates some semantic methods of knowledge engineering and natural language processing, some measures of statistic sociology and some electrodynamic laws, applied to the economic performance and social climate optimisation. It is currently under experimentation, in line with the Socioprise project, funded by the French State Secretariat at the prospective and development of the digital economy.},

	Abstract = {Searching for the meaning of the word personalization on a popular search engine, one finds twenty-three different answers, includ- ing the process of matching categorized content with different end users based on business rules ... upon page request to a Webserver, using continually adjusted user profiles to match content or services to individ- uals, and also real-time tailoring of displays, particularly Web pages, to a specific customers known preferences, such as previous purchases. A little more generally, personalization is a process by which it is pos- sible to give the user optimal support in accessing, retrieving, and stor- ing information, where solutions are built so as to fit the preferences, the characteristics and the taste of the individual. This result can be achieved only by exploiting machine-interpretable semantic information, e.g. about the possible resources, about the user him/herself, about the context, about the goal of the interaction. Personalization is realized by an inferencing process applied to the semantic information, which can be carried out in many different ways depending on the specific task. The objective of this paper is to provide a coherent introduction into issues and methods for realizing personalization in the Semantic Web.},

@article{Izuma2013,
	Abstract = {Our preferences are influenced by what other people like, but depend critically on how we feel about those people, a classical psychological effect called "cognitive balance." Here, we manipulated preferences for goods by telling participants the preferences of strongly liked or disliked groups of other people. Participants@ preferences converged to those of the liked group, but diverged from the disliked group. Activation of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) tracked the discrepancy between one@s own preference and its social ideal and was associated with subsequent preference change (toward the liked and away from the disliked group), even several months later. A follow-up study found overlapping activation in this same region of dmPFC with negative monetary outcomes, but no overlap with nearby activations induced by response conflict. A single social encounter can thus result in long-lasting preference change, a mechanism that recruits dmPFC and that may reflect the aversive nature of cognitive imbalance},

	Abstract = {This review covers recent developments in the social influence literature, focusing primarily on compliance and conformity research published between 1997 and 2002. The principles and processes underlying a target's susceptibility to outside influences are considered in light of three goals fundamental to rewarding human functioning. Specifically, targets are motivated to form accurate perceptions of reality and react accordingly, to develop and preserve meaningful social relationships, and to maintain a favorable self-concept. Consistent with the current movement in compliance and conformity research, this review emphasizes the ways in which these goals interact with external forces to engender social influence processes that are subtle, indirect, and outside of awareness.},

With participants' consent, these data can be recorded retrospectively in a convenient, accurate, and inexpensive way. Based on our experience in designing, implementing, and maintaining multiple Facebook-based psychological studies that attracted over 10 million participants, we demonstrate how to recruit participants using Facebook, incentivize them effectively, and maximize their engagement. We also outline the most important opportunities and challenges associated with using Facebook for research, provide several practical guidelines on how to successfully implement studies on Facebook, and finally, discuss ethical considerations.},

	Abstract = {Facebook is quickly becoming one of the most popular tools for social communication. However, Facebook is somewhat different from other Social Networking Sites as it demonstrates an offline-to-online trend; that is, the majority of Facebook Friends are met offline and then added later. The present research investigated how the Five-Factor Model of personality relates to Facebook use. Despite some expected trends regarding Extraversion and Openness to Experience, results indicated that personality factors were not as influential as previous literature would suggest. The results also indicated that a motivation to communicate was influential in terms of Facebook use. It is suggested that different motivations may be influential in the decision to use tools such as Facebook, especially when individual functions of Facebook are being considered. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Judging others' personalities is an essential skill in successful social living, as personality is a key driver behind people's interactions, behaviors, and emotions. Although accurate personality judgments stem from social-cognitive skills, developments in machine learning show that computer models can also make valid judgments. This study compares the accuracy of human and computer-based personality judgments, using a sample of 86,220 volunteers who completed a 100-item personality questionnaire. We show that (i) computer predictions based on a generic digital footprint (Facebook Likes) are more accurate (r = 0.56) than those made by the participants' Facebook friends using a personality questionnaire (r = 0.49); (ii) computer models show higher interjudge agreement; and (iii) computer personality judgments have higher external validity when predicting life outcomes such as substance use, political attitudes, and physical health; for some outcomes, they even outperform the self-rated personality scores. Computers outpacing humans in personality judgment presents significant opportunities and challenges in the areas of psychological assessment, marketing, and privacy.},

The analysis presented is based on a dataset of over 58,000 volunteers who provided their Facebook Likes, detailed demographic profiles, and the results of several psychometric tests. The proposed model uses dimensionality reduction for preprocessing the Likes data, which are then entered into logistic/linear regression to predict individual psychodemographic profiles from Likes. The model correctly discriminates between homosexual and heterosexual men in 88{\%} of cases, African Americans and Caucasian Americans in 95{\%} of cases, and between Democrat and Republican in 85{\%} of cases. For the personality trait "Openness," prediction accuracy is close to the test-retest accuracy of a standard personality test. We give examples of associations between attributes and Likes and discuss implications for online personalization and privacy.},

	Abstract = {Location-based social networks (LBSNs) are a recent phenomenon for sharing a presence at everyday locations with others and have the potential to give new insights into human behaviour. To date, due to barriers in data collection, there has been little research into how our personality relates to the categories of place that we visit. Using the Foursquare LBSN, we have released a web-based participatory application that examines the personality characteristics and checkin behaviour of volunteer Foursquare users. Over a four-month period, we examine the behaviour and the "Big Five" personality traits of 174 anonymous users who had collectively checked in 487,396 times at 119,746 venues. Significant correlations are found for Conscientiousness, Openness and Neuroticism. In contrast to some previous findings about online social networks, Conscientiousness is positively correlated with LBSN usage. Openness correlates mainly with location-based variables (average distance between venues visited, venue popularity, number of checkins at sociable venues). For Neuroticism, further negative correlations are found (number of venues visited, number of sociable venues visited). No correlations are found for the other personality traits, which is surprising for Extroversion. The study concludes that personality traits help to explain individual differences in LBSN usage and the type of places visited.},

The biological view of the Five-factor theory proposes the plaster hypothesis: All personality traits stop changing by age 30. In contrast, contextualist perspectives propose that changes should be more varied and should persist throughout adulthood. This study compared these perspectives in a large (N=132,515) sample of adults aged 21-60 who completed a Big Five personality measure on the Internet. Conscientiousness and Agreeableness increased throughout early and middle adulthood at varying rates; Neuroticism declined among women but did not change among men. The variety in patterns of change suggests that the Big Five traits are complex phenomena subject to a variety of developmental influences.},

Most existing theories of homophily are based on a descriptive approach and abstract away from equilibrium considerations. I show that the equilibrium structure of homophily has empirical power, as it can be used to recover underlying preference parameters. I build a non-cooperative model of network formation, which produces a unique, em- pirically realistic equilibrium network. Individuals have homophilic preferences and face capacity constraints on the number of links. I develop a novel empirical method, based on the shape of the equilibrium network, which allows for the identification and estimation of the underlying homophilic preferences. I apply this new methodology to race-based choices regarding friendship decisions among American teenagers.

	Abstract = { In what traits do people interact with others who are similar to them in completely anonymous online communication? Can those traits contribute to greater exchange of opinion and information across the sociodemographic boundaries that often limit interaction between social strata? To answer this question concerning online homophily, we combined survey data on 7,287 users (aged 18 and above) of a Korean online dating advice platform with their behavioral data from June 2015 to August 2015 and explored whether advice exchange occurred between users with similar sociodemographic and personality traits. On this platform, two types of interactions occurred as follows: (1) responses to a randomly distributed problem submitted by an advice seeker and (2) the seeker's indication of approval of any of the responses given. The study found that (1) a receiver was more likely to respond to problems submitted by seekers of a comparable age and that (2) seekers were more likely to approve of a response if the seeker and receiver had similar educational backgrounds. By contrast, homophily based on personality traits was not observed even though some personality traits significantly affected the likelihood of both response and approval. Our findings suggest that online communication may breed sociodemographic homophily, whether based on age or education, more than expected or intended while not easily fostering alternative forms of homophily, such as personality homophily, which can potentially cut across borders dividing sociodemographic groups.

@article{Henrich2010,
	Abstract = {Behavioral scientists routinely publish broad claims about human psychology and behavior in the world's top journals based on samples drawn entirely from Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) societies. Researchers -- often implicitly -- assume that either there is little variation across human populations, or that these " standard subjects " are as representative of the species as any other population. Are these assumptions justified? Here, our review of the comparative database from across the behavioral sciences suggests both that there is substantial variability in experimental results across populations and that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the species -- frequent outliers. The domains reviewed include visual perception, fairness, cooperation, spatial reasoning, categorization and inferential induction, moral reasoning, reasoning styles, self-concepts and related motivations, and the heritability of IQ. The findings suggest that members of WEIRD societies, including young children, are among the least representative populations one could find for generalizing about humans. Many of these findings involve domains that are associated with fundamental aspects of psychology, motivation, and behavior -- hence, there are no obvious a priori grounds for claiming that a particular behavioral phenomenon is universal based on sampling from a single subpopulation. Overall, these empirical patterns suggests that we need to be less cavalier in addressing questions of human nature on the basis of data drawn from this particularly thin, and rather unusual, slice of humanity. We close by proposing ways to structurally re-organize the behavioral sciences to best tackle these challenges.},

	Abstract = {Adaptive applications may benefit from having models of users' personality to adapt their behavior accordingly. There is a wide variety of domains in which this can be useful, i.e., assistive technologies, e-learning, e-commerce, health care or recommender systems, among others. The most commonly used procedure to obtain the user personality consists of asking the user to fill in questionnaires. However, on one hand, it would be desirable to obtain the user personality as unobtrusively as possible, yet without compromising the reliability of the model built. On the other hand, our hypothesis is that users with similar personality are expected to show common behavioral patterns when interacting through virtual social networks, and that these patterns can be mined in order to predict the tendency of a user personality. With the goal of inferring personality from the analysis of user interactions within social networks, we have developed TP2010, a Facebook application. It has been used to collect information about the personality traits of more than 20,000 users, along with their interactions within Facebook. Based on all the collected data, automatic classifiers were trained by using different machine-learning techniques, with the purpose of looking for interaction patterns that provide information about the users' personality traits. These classifiers are able to predict user personality starting from parameters related to user interactions, such as the number of friends or the number of wall posts. The results show that the classifiers have a high level of accuracy, making the proposed approach a reliable method for predicting the user personality {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Currarini2016,
	Abstract = {Biases in meeting opportunities have been recently shown to play a key role for the emergence of homophily in social networks (see Currarini et al., 2009). The aim of this paper is to provide a simple microfoundation of these biases in a model where the size and type-composition of the meeting pools are shaped by agents׳ socialization decisions. In particular, agents either inbreed (direct search only to similar types) or outbreed (direct search to population at large). When outbreeding is costly, this is shown to induce stark equilibrium behavior of a threshold type: agents ``inbreed'' (i.e. mostly meet their own type) if, and only if, their group is above certain size. We show that this threshold equilibrium generates patterns of in-group and cross-group ties that are consistent with empirical evidence of homophily in two paradigmatic instances: high school friendships and interethnic marriages.},

@article{Lobel2016,
	Abstract = {We study a sequential model of Bayesian social learning in networks in which agents have heterogeneous preferences, and neighbors tend to have similar preferences---a phe- nomenon known as homophily. We find that the density of network connections de- termines the impact of preference diversity and homophily on learning. When connec- tions are sparse, diverse preferences are harmful to learning, and homophily may lead to substantial improvements. In contrast, in a dense network, preference diversity is beneficial. Intuitively, diverse ties introduce more independence between observations while providing less information individually. Homophilous connections individually carry more useful information, but multiple observations become redundant.},

@article{Wimmer2014,
	Abstract = {A notable feature of U.S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily--- the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial back- ground and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by com- paring its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily re- garding nonracial categories (e.g., students from ``elite'' backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.},

	Abstract = {As an alternative to algebraic and schematic models of social judgment, a new exemplar-based model holds that representations of specific individuals influence judgments about persons and groups. (1) As the perceiver encounters or thinks about an individual, a representation of that exemplar as interpreted by the perceiver is stored in memory. (2) When a target person is encountered later, known attributes of similar exemplars from memory influence judgments about the target. Similarity is modulated by the perceiver's attention to stimulus dimensions. (3) Social and motivational factors, including perceiver self-schemata, social context, and in-group/out-group dynamics, influence social judgment by affecting perceivers' attention to dimensions. Computer simulations show how the model accounts for social influences on exemplar access and use, and therefore, on the content of social judgments.

Finally, we introduce a family of transformation-based accounts of similarity, called [`]Representational Distortion', as a specific example of a transformational approach to similarity.},

	Abstract = {Questions the metric and dimensional assumptions that underlie the geometric representation of similarity on both theoretical and empirical grounds. A new set-theoretical approach to similarity is developed in which objects are represented as collections of features and similarity is described as a feature-matching process. Specifically, a set of qualitative assumptions is shown to imply the contrast model, which expresses the similarity between objects as a linear combination of the measures of their common and distinctive features. Several predictions of the contrast model are tested in studies of similarity with both semantic and perceptual stimuli. The model is used to uncover, analyze, and explain a variety of empirical phenomena such as the role of common and distinctive features, the relations between judgments of similarity and difference, the presence of asymmetric similarities, and the effects of context on judgments of similarity. The contrast model generalizes standard representations of similarity data in terms of clusters and trees. It is also used to analyze the relations of prototypicality and family resemblance.

Illustrative applications of this method to several previously published matrices of the confusions between signals of the Morse code are presented for the first time. The results seem to provide useful information about how these dot-and-dash patterns are processed in man. },

	Abstract = {This paper examines bias toward status-similarity in adult friendships in Detroit and a West German city. Principles of meeting and "mating," by which strangers are converted to acquaintances and acquaintances to friends, are stated. One of these, the proximity principle, claims that the more similar people are, the more likely they will meet and become friends. This principle is tested in matrices of friendship choice for twelve social characteristics. Two statistical measures of bias are used (odds ratio and marginal ratio) and their properties discussed. Compared to a random-choice model, adult friendships show strong bias toward status similarity for all social characteristics. Bias is strongest for "edge" categories of ranked statuses and for "best" friends. The less similar two people are in social characteristics, the less likely they are to be close friends. Demographic characteristics tend to show more bias toward homogeneous choices than other characteristics. These findings are explained and further analyses of adult friendship structure and dynamics are discussed.},

	Abstract = {This paper examines sex differences in the exclusiveness of children's dyadic friendships. First, differences in the frequencies of triad types representing exclusive and nonexclusive dyadic friendships are compared. As expected, girls are found to have a greater frequency of exclusive triads than boys while boys are found to have a higher percentage of nonexclusive triads than girls. Girls are also shown to have a higher frequency of exclusive than comparable nonexclusive triads while no such pattern exists for boys. A second analysis examines movement across triad types over time; it shows that girls tend to return to an isolated dyad while boys tend to expand their dyadic friendships to include a third person. The implications of these results for differential learning of social skills and for the experience of newcomers to a group are discussed.},

	Abstract = {A key element of the social networks on the internet such as Facebook and Flickr is that they encourage users to create connections between themselves, other users and objects. One important task that has been approached in the literature that deals with such data is to use social graphs to predict user behavior (e.g. joining a group of interest). More specifically, we study the cold-start problem, where users only participate in some relations, which we will call social relations, but not in the relation on which the predic- tions are made, which we will refer to as target relations.$\backslash$nWe propose a formalization of the problem and a princi- pled approach to it based on multi-relational factorization techniques. Furthermore, we derive a principled feature ex- traction scheme from the social data to extract predictors for a classifier on the target relation. Experiments conducted on real world datasets show that our approach outperforms current methods.},

@article{Liu2013,
	Abstract = {Recommendation systems have received great attention for their commercial value in today's online business world. However, most recommendation systems encounter the data sparsity problem and the cold-start problem. To improve recommendation accuracy in this circumstance, additional sources of information about the users and items should be incorporated in recommendation systems. In this paper, we modify the model in Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization, and propose two recommendation approaches fusing social relations and item contents with user ratings in a novel way. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and can be applied to trust-aware or content-aware recommendation systems with very large dataset. Experimental results on three real world datasets show that our method gets more accurate recommendation results with faster converging speed than other matrix factorization based methods. We also verify our method in cold-start settings, and our method gets more accurate recommendation results than the compared approaches. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {We propose a recommendation method that considers the user's individual preference and influence from other users in social media. This method predicts the user's individual preference and influence from other users by applying the probability of divergence from random-selection based on a statistical hypothesis test as a form of modified content-based filtering. We evaluated the proposed method by focusing on the rate at which items that have recommended tags are contained among all items. The proposed method is shown to have higher accuracy than traditional content-based filtering. It is especially effective when some percentage of the items have recommendation tags.},

@article{Hogg201029,
	Abstract = {Identifying consumer preferences is a key challenge in customizing electronic commerce sites to individual users. The increasing availability of online social networks provides one approach to this problem: people linked in these networks often share preferences, allowing inference of interest in products based on knowledge of a consumer's network neighbors and their interests. This paper evaluates the benefits of inference from online social networks in two contexts: a random graph model and a web site allowing people to both express preferences and form distinct social and preference links. We determine conditions on network topology and preference correlations leading to extended clusters of people with similar interests. Knowledge of when such clusters occur improves the usefulness of social network-based inference for identifying products likely to interest consumers based on information from a few people in the network. Such estimates could help sellers design customized bundles of products and improve combinatorial auctions for complementary products. },

@article{YaleChen,
	Abstract = {After making a choice between 2 objects, people reevaluate their chosen item more positively and their
rejected item more negatively (i.e., they spread the alternatives). Since Brehm's (1956) initial free-choice
experiment, psychologists have interpreted the spreading of alternatives as evidence for choice-induced
attitude change. It is widely assumed to occur because choosing creates cognitive dissonance, which is
then reduced through rationalization. In this article, we express concern with this interpretation, noting
that the free-choice paradigm (FCP) will produce spreading, even if people's attitudes remain unchanged.
Specifically, if people's ratings/rankings are an imperfect measure of their preferences and their choices
are at least partially guided by their preferences, then the FCP will measure spreading, even if people's
preferences remain perfectly stable. We show this, first by proving a mathematical theorem that identifies
a set of conditions under which the FCP will measure spreading, even absent attitude change. We then
experimentally demonstrate that these conditions appear to hold and that the FCP measures a spread of
alternatives, even when this spreading cannot have been caused by choice. We discuss how the problem
we identify applies to the basic FCP paradigm as well as to all variants that examine moderators and
mediators of spreading. The results suggest a reassessment of the free-choice paradigm and, perhaps, the
conclusions that have been drawn from it.},

	The measure constructs the concept tree by Wordnet and computes the

	edge weight and information content. The result indicates the measure

Preference issue is heavily studied in Semantic Web research area. The existing preference management approaches only consider the importance of concepts for capturing users interests. This paper presents a metamodeling approach to preference management. Preference meta model consists of concepts and semantic relations to represent users?? interests. Users may have the same type preferences in different domains. Thus, metamodeling must be used to define similar preferences for interoperability in different domains. In this paper, preference meta model defines a general storage structure to manage different types of preferences for personalized applications},
